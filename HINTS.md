### Hollow Rectangle
`
Hint:-
You have to print some spaces between the rectangle to make it hollow rectangle.
i.e You have to print spaces instaed of "*", similar to the above question  except in 1st row, last row, 1st column and last column.
`
### Palindromic Pattern
`
Hint:-
In this Program first you have to print half pyramid after 180 degree rotaion using numbers and then you have to print half pyramid but from 2nd column.
`
### Diamond Pattern
`
Hint:- It's very similar to palindromic Pattern but with "*". In Palindromic Pattern you have to go from 1 to nth row
and in this you have to do same first but after that you have to make mirror image. So this time you need to go from nth row to 1st row.
