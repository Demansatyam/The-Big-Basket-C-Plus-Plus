Before starting this repo i was not able to keep myself consistent and motivated towards my learning journey so i decided why not make a checklist repo which can somehow provide me a sense of achievement and also keep track of my learning the programming with c++. So thats why i decided to make this repo.

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.
